trip\07\03485.wav=Ah, you disagree, good, that can only help her...@967828
trip\07\03486.wav=God, Grace, if you love art so much, why can't you just do painting on the side, on the weekends or something?@968368
trip\07\03487.wav=Are -- are you saying I'm afraid of something?  @968972
trip\07\03488.wav=Ahh! Ho ho... you -- heh -- uhh...@969268

trip\07\03491.wav=Actually I think therapy could cure Grace of her obsession with being an artist -- @970800
trip\07\03492.wav=and we could stop wasting our time and money on all this redecorating!  @971392
trip\07\03493.wav=Uhh, finally, somebody to back me up -- that helps us!@971892
trip\07\03494.wav=Why don't you just do it then?  @972268

trip\08\03503.wav=See, I don't think you really want to be an artist.  @975216
trip\08\03504.wav=This is all just something for you to blame me for.@975636
trip\08\03505.wav=See, I don't think you really could be an artist if you wanted to.  You can't do it.@976124
trip\08\03506.wav=Uhh...@976540
trip\08\03508.wav=I've been right all along.@977116

trip\08\03517.wav=I never said such a thing, you're completely making that up!@979620
trip\08\03518.wav=Thank you, saying that might just help her understand!@980064
trip\08\03519.wav=Anyhow, it's true -- if you really wanted to paint art, which I don't think you do, @980540
trip\08\03520.wav=you could do it on the weekends, instead of obsessively redecorating our apartment.@981180
trip\08\03521.wav=I -- @981592
trip\08\03522.wav=Uhh...@981692
trip\08\03523.wav=Uhh, I -- Grace, I don't remember what I said.@981884

trip\08\03525.wav=See, Grace, you're the one turning this into such a big issue.  @982760
trip\08\03526.wav=In fact I saved you from wasting your life as an artist.@983248
trip\08\03527.wav=Uhh, okay, look, if I didn't save you, I definitely helped you... @983692
trip\08\03528.wav=And at the time, you were happy for that!@984128
trip\08\03529.wav=You are just unable to accept that you're not an artist!@984532
trip\08\03530.wav=uhh...@984836
trip\08\03531.wav=I still say advertising is the best thing for you.  @985052

trip\08\03544.wav=Your art career...?@988640
trip\08\03545.wav=Ah, you disagree with Grace, that might help her...@988900
trip\08\03546.wav=Sometimes I wish you were a goddamn artist, so you could see what that life would really be like!@989424
trip\08\03547.wav=I don't hate -- it's not like... I... I -- uhh...@989964
trip\08\03548.wav=I, I...  I -- I don't know what to say.@990304
trip\08\03549.wav=Painting, uh, just, uh, seems so pointless, what do you possibly expect to gain from it?@990748
trip\08\03550.wav=you're saying I'm... depressed?@991232
trip\08\03551.wav=You know what's sad... @991476
trip\08\03552.wav=all this wasted time and energy I've spent trying convince you that you didn't 'give up art'...@991896
trip\08\03553.wav=It's pathetic really.@992408

trip\08\03564.wav=You're so angry, but you don't do anything about it, except bitch and moan!@995088
trip\08\03565.wav=You've always been angry about something, Grace... if it's not one thing, it's another...@995668
trip\08\03566.wav=See, @996108
trip\08\03567.wav=Grace will tell you she's 'angry', but the truth is, there's no reason for it!@996396
trip\08\03568.wav=Uhh, look, don't give me your touchy-feely bullshit, I can't do anything with that.@996984
trip\08\03569.wav=I mean, Grace, it's so ridiculous to get angry about this art stuff, that you wisely stopped wasting your time with a long time ago.@997740
trip\08\03570.wav=Oh, God...@998360
trip\08\03571.wav=You know what makes me so angry?  @998784
trip\08\03572.wav=How you've so conveniently forgotten how much you used to actually hate painting!@999204
trip\08\03573.wav=Ah, thank you, just saying that helps us!@999700
trip\08\03574.wav=It's true!  She wanted to give up painting, and it makes me so angry that she pretends otherwise!@1000184
trip\08\03575.wav=Uhh...@1000652
trip\08\03576.wav=No, what really makes me angry is how fricking miserable I know you'd be if you actually were a so-called 'artist'.@1001036
trip\08\03577.wav=No, it's true, she's right, it's totally annoying!  @1001684
trip\08\03578.wav=God... it makes me so angry.  @1002036
