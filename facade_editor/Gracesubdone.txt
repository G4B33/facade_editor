grace\03\01240.wav=maybe you'd like some juice, or a mineral water?@162624
grace\03\01241.wav=No no, @162908
grace\03\01242.wav=maybe you'd like just a simple glass of white wine?@163140
grace\03\01243.wav=No no, @163436
grace\03\01244.wav=how about something simple, like a nice glass of chardonnay?@163680
grace\03\01245.wav=Trip that's not what he wants.@164072
grace\03\01246.wav=Trip that's not what she wants.@164348
grace\03\01247.wav=Trip don't force your fancy drinks on him.  @164652

grace\03\01250.wav=Trip we don't all share your infatuation with mixed drinks.@165708
grace\03\01251.wav=Trip maybe our friend isn't as excited by your suggestion as you are.@166208
grace\03\01252.wav=you'd prefer a simple glass of water, right?@166664
grace\03\01253.wav=you'd prefer a simple glass of juice, right?@167020
grace\03\01254.wav=you'd prefer a simple glass of soda, right?@167380

grace\03\01265.wav=That's Trip, always happiest when he's making fancy drinks for everyone in the room.@170396
grace\03\01266.wav=You know Trip, he gets such pleasure from making fancy drinks for everybody.@170988
grace\03\01267.wav=You know Trip, he never gets tired of making fancy drinks for whoever will indulge him.@171576
grace\03\01268.wav=Anyhow...@172016
grace\03\01269.wav=Ah, the funny thing is, Trip doesn't even like the taste of alcohol.@172292
grace\03\01270.wav=I sometimes wonder if Trip spends so much time fixing drinks to avoid having real conversation with the guests.@172920
grace\03\01271.wav=Sometimes I'm afraid Trip thinks the best way to a friend's heart is through his liver.@173628
grace\03\01272.wav=Trip has always been partial to winning his friends over by way of the mixed drink.@174248
grace\03\01273.wav=So anyway,@174684
grace\03\01274.wav=Yes, sometimes a simple glass of wine is better than those fancy drinks you always insist on making.@175052
grace\03\01275.wav=Yes, you don't need to push the fancy drinks tonight.@175656
grace\03\01276.wav=Trip, Trip, Trip... don't go overboard with the drink preparation tonight.@380212

grace\03\01280.wav=Trip don't get yourself worked up over the drinks.@382008
grace\03\01281.wav=Trip's getting a little carried away...  maybe you just want some juice, or a mineral water?@382504
grace\03\01282.wav=I think Trip is pressuring you too much... how about just a simple glass of white wine?@383140
grace\03\01283.wav=I think you'd prefer something simple and light, like a nice glass of chardonnay, yes?@383764
grace\03\01284.wav=Trip, darling, that's not what he wants.@384280
grace\03\01285.wav=Trip, darling, that's not what she wants.@384616

grace\03\01302.wav=Trip thinks he's at his classiest when he's on the serving end of a swizzle stick.@390992
grace\03\01303.wav=Trip's favorite pastime is to get the blood alcohol content of his guests higher than his golf score.@391660
grace\03\01304.wav=Trip would try to serve you one of his high class drinks before even saying hello if he could.@392344
grace\03\01305.wav=My dad bought Trip a silver plated cocktail shaker for Christmas a few years back -- the rest is history.@393052
grace\03\01306.wav=One martini, two martini, three martini, floor...@393680
grace\03\01307.wav=So anyway,@393980
grace\03\01308.wav=Yeah, a glass of wine is seems so much better right now than one of your classy drinks.@394296
grace\03\01309.wav=Yeah, we really don't need the fancy drinks tonight.@394848
grace\03\01310.wav=As for my drink...@175980
