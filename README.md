## Plans on future releases

- Subtitle editor (The basics are done, I can read and replace it, just need to assign the sound files to their corresponding subtitles, and make some kind of editor that's easy to use)
- Lower Windows requirement to XP (Currently supports Windows 7 x86,x64 and up because of .Net 4.7.2 requirement for NAudio library)
- Face manipulator (Don't count on this one, I'm not 100% sure that it will work)

## How to build

- Open facade_editor.sln in Visual Studio
- Press F6
